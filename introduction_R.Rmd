## R et Rstudio 

RStudio est l' *IDE* de R:

- Environnement (objets en mémoire)

## Points forts et faiblesses 

The main advantages of R are the fact that Ris freeware and that there is a lot of help availableonline.  It is quite similar to other programmingpackages such as MatLab (not freeware), but moreuser-friendly than programming languages such asC++ or Fortran.  You can use R as it is, but foreducational purposes we prefer to use R in combi-nation with the RStudio interface (also freeware),which  has an  organized layout and  several  extraoptions.
